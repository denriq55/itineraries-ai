# AI Itinerary Generator

## Project Description  
This Laravel app generates personalized travel itineraries using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo model. Users fill out a simple form with their destination, budget, trip length, and interests, and the AI creates a custom travel plan. It was a great way to learn how to connect an AI API and handle user input.

## Features  
- Simple form for entering travel details  
- Input validation to make sure the data is right  
- Calls OpenAI’s API to generate personalized itineraries  
- Shows the AI’s response right on the page  
- Basic error handling if something goes wrong  
- Uses Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive styling
